# Abstract:

What factors lead to customer satisfaction for an Airline? This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. What factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger? Can you predict passenger satisfaction?

# Design:

This project is one of the T5 Data Science Boot Camp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle. In this module we will be laying the foundation for our analysis by processing and exploring a large amount of data and classify it by using classification modules. The dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. Get the data here.
